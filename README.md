## Password Generator
## Alyson Bennett


## Assignment Objectives
The goal of this homework assignment was to create a random password generator using Javascript, with accompanying HTML and CSS files.

The password that is created must meet the following criteria:
    1. Must contain between 8 - 128 characters, AND
    2. Must contain at least on of the following character types:
        -lowercase letters
        -uppercase letters
        -numbers
        -special characters

The user must answer questions posed in prompts to generate a random string of characters that can be used as a secure password. If the user selects 7 or less characters or 129 or more characters, than they should be prompted to select again. If they do not choose a character type, they will be looped through the prompts again.

## Process
To begin this project, I psudo-coded the necessary steps to complete the project. From there, I did a lot of Googling to find the appropriate functions and syntax to complete the steps I had outlined. There was a lot of trial and error! Plus a little help from my tutor went a long way.

After finally getting the the code to produce what I wanted, I tweaked a few things in my HTML and CSS to display the way it needed to look. 

## Screen Shots of the Finalized Assignment
This is what the user will see when they first open the website:

When the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button, they will be prompted to select password criteria:

After selecting their criteria, their random password will be displayed on the screen:

## Final Thoughts
While this project was very challenging, I feel that I learned a lot and made some progess in understanding how JavaScript works. I know I have a long way to go, but I am excited to dig in more. 

Thank you.
